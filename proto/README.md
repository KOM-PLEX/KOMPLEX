# KOMPLEX Learning Platform - UI Prototypes

This directory contains 3 different HTML prototypes for the KOMPLEX STEM learning platform, each showcasing a different approach to the user interface and navigation structure.

## Overview

KOMPLEX is a STEM-focused, open-sourced learning platform aimed at high school students in Cambodia. The platform is designed to provide interactive lessons, exercises, and resources in core science and math subjects—aligned with the national curriculum and modeled after real study materials widely used in tutoring centers and exam prep booklets.

## Prototype Descriptions

### Prototype 1: Sidebar Navigation (Blue Accent)

**File:** `prototype1/index.html`
**Color Scheme:** White background with blue (#2563eb) accents

**Key Features:**

- **Sidebar Navigation:** Fixed sidebar with hierarchical navigation showing subjects, grades, and lessons
- **Dashboard Layout:** Main content area with cards showing current progress and upcoming lessons
- **Hierarchical Structure:** Clear organization from subjects → grades → lessons → sub-lessons
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress bars for each lesson
- **Clean Design:** Minimalist approach with focus on content hierarchy

**Best For:** Users who prefer traditional navigation patterns and want to see the full curriculum structure at a glance.

### Prototype 2: Card-Based Layout (Green Accent)

**File:** `prototype2/index.html`
**Color Scheme:** White background with green (#059669) accents

**Key Features:**

- **Card-Based Design:** Subject cards with lesson previews and status indicators

## Common Elements Across All Prototypes

### Curriculum Structure

All prototypes follow the same hierarchical structure:

- **Subjects:** Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology
- **Grades:** Grade 10, 11, 12 (focusing on Grade 12)
- **Lessons:** Specific topics (e.g., Complex Numbers, Derivatives, Limits)
- **Sub-lessons:** Detailed breakdowns (e.g., Limit 0/0, Limit ∞/∞)

### Key Features Highlighted

1. **AI Assistant:** Photo-based math problem solving
2. **Interactive Lessons:** Visual graphs, 3D models, step-by-step solving
3. **Community Forum:** Student discussions and help
4. **Curriculum Alignment:** Cambodia's national curriculum
5. **Progress Tracking:** Visual progress indicators and statistics

### Design Principles

- **Simple Color Scheme:** White backgrounds with single accent colors
- **Clean Typography:** Segoe UI font family for readability
- **Responsive Design:** Grid-based layouts that adapt to screen sizes
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between different content levels
- **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects and smooth transitions

## Usage

To view the prototypes:

1. Open any of the HTML files in a web browser
2. For Prototype 3, use the tab navigation to explore different sections
3. All prototypes are self-contained with embedded CSS and JavaScript

## Next Steps

These prototypes serve as starting points for the KOMPLEX platform development. They demonstrate different approaches to:

- Navigation and information architecture
- Content organization and hierarchy
- User interaction patterns
- Visual design and branding

Choose the approach that best aligns with your target users' preferences and technical requirements.
