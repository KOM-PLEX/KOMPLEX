## 🌟 About KOMPLEX

**KOMPLEX** is an open-source STEM learning platform specifically designed for high school students in Cambodia. Our mission is to democratize quality education by providing free, interactive lessons and resources that align with the national curriculum.

### The Problem We're Solving

Many Cambodian students struggle with STEM subjects and rely heavily on expensive private tutoring and paid summary books. KOMPLEX offers a free, self-paced alternative that promotes deep understanding over rote memorization through interactive visual learning.

### Our Vision

- 🆓 **Free and accessible** to every student
- 🎯 **Interactive and visual** with 3D models and graphs
- 📚 **Curriculum-aligned** with Cambodian education standards
