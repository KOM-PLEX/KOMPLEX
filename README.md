# KOMPLEX

**KOMPLEX** is a STEM-focused, open-sourced learning platform aimed at high school students in Cambodia. The platform is designed to provide interactive lessons, exercises, and resources in core science and math subjects—aligned with the national curriculum and modeled after real study materials widely used in tutoring centers and exam prep booklets.

Inspired by **W3Schools** and similar platforms, our goal is to address ongoing challenges in the Cambodian education system, where many students rely heavily on private tutoring and paid summary books to grasp fundamental concepts. KOMPLEX aims to offer a **free**, **self-paced**, and **engaging alternative** that supports **deeper understanding** rather than rote memorization.
